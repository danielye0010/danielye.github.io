## About Me

<!-- I'm a <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/biostatistics/" target="_blank"> Statistics</a> Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank"> New York University</a>, -->
I'm a Ph.D. student in Industrial Engineering at <a href="https://www.imse.iastate.edu/" target="_blank"> Iowa State University</a>, working under the mentorship of Dr.<a href="https://www.imse.iastate.edu/directory/qing-li/" target="_blank"> Qing Li</a>. My research involves developing statistical and machine learning models that incorporate simulation, optimization, and probability to understand advanced manufacturing systems and improve performance.

Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I completed my Master's degree in Statistics from <a href="https://cdis.wisc.edu/" target = "_blank"> University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. During my time there, I worked as a Research Cyberinfrastructure Project Assistant at<a href="https://it.wisc.edu/about/division-of-information-technology/research-cyberinfrastructure-2/" target="_blank">the CTO office</a>. Besides, I held two Bachelor's degree in B.S. Statistics and B.A. Economics from <a href="https://www.d.umn.edu/" target = "_blank"> University of Minnesota Duluth</a>.

Outside of academia, I began my journey as a professional swimmer at the age of 5 and went on to achieve several regional and national championships. I'm also passionate about Chinese calligraphy, and my artwork has been exhibited in top galleries and museums including the <a href="http://www.namoc.org/" target="_blank"> National Art Museum of China (Beijing)</a>. In addition, I am also interested in oil painting, and aeromodelling.  -->
